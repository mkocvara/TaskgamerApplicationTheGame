# Taskgamer Application: The Game
This is a tiny goofy game made to accompany a tiny goofy application to a tiny goofy Uni society's tiny and goofy game show.

You are me, your task is to be accepted as a contestant by eliminating all the other applicants.

Your time starts now!

The game is written in MelonJS, a JavaScript game engine that I learned for this project. The whole game was made in about a week and isn't the greatest professional standard, as my focus was on getting functionality in and having fun, rather than constructing a solid game with longevity. Commit messages admittedly reflect this too, I was having perhaps too much fun with them.

The awesome music was made by my younger brother, Michal Koƒçvara.
